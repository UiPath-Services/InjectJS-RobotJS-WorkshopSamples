# InjectJS-RobotJS-WorkshopSamples

## Intro
A multitude of challenges can appear when developing automations for web applications. 
These range from hard to form selectors to difficulty in ensuring seamless communication between the robot and user.
While web applications are not the only ones where we can find these challenges, the possibility of injecting or augmenting them with custom JavaScript does present a unique opportunity of solving these issues in a highly efficient and robust manner.

## Samples
This repo contains the following samples:
+ Extending a website's features by **Injecting custom JavaScript Code**
+ Automatically injecting JavaScript into a page via the **Trigger Activities**
+ Extending a website's features and allowing users to execute jobs directly from the browser using **a Chrome Extension and RobotJS**



## Observations
+ Browser Extensions samples are built for Chrome using the MV3 standard
+ All Samples require the ACME Test Website to run: https://acme-test.uipath.com/work-items (you will need to create an account in order to use this)
